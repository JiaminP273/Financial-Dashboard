MERN Finance Dashboard App

This repository contains the code for a finance dashboard application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The app provides users with financial data and insights through visually appealing charts and predictions generated using machine learning algorithms.
Features

The MERN Finance Dashboard App offers the following features:

Financial Data Visualization: The application leverages Recharts, a powerful charting library, to create visually appealing and interactive charts within the dashboard. Users can view and analyze their financial data using various chart types, such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts.

Data Integration: The backend connects to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve financial data. Users can input their financial information, such as income, expenses, and investments, which are then visualized in the dashboard.

Machine Learning Integration: The application incorporates machine learning algorithms and models to generate predictions and insights. These models analyze historical financial data and provide users with forecasts, trends, and suggestions for financial decision-making.

User Authentication and Authorization: The app includes user authentication and authorization functionality. Users can create an account, log in, and securely access their financial data. The authorization system ensures that users can only view and manage their own information.
